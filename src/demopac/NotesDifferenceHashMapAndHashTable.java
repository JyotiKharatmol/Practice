		/* Hash Map  
		 * 
		 * 1. It is not synchronized and thread safe
		 * eg - 5 classes/threads can use the methods, variables of HashMap class simultaneously and hence it is not thread safe
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 2. Hash Map accepts null values in the elements/objects
		 * h.put(0, null)
		 * eg - if the phone number of an employee is not present at the moment, then while a creating a list of employee and their details,
		 * user can input null value too
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 3. Hash Map uses iterator method to iterate over all the elements present in the list
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Hash Table
		 * 
		 * 1. It is synchronized and thread safe
		 * Only when one thread finishes using the resources of hash table class, the other thread can have access to the resources. 
		 * It is in the sequential order/synchronized order
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 2. It does not accept null values
		 * eg - h.put(1, null) is not acceptable
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 3. Hash Table uses enamulator operator to iterate over the elements present in the list
